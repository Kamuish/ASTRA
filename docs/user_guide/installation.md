# Installation

Installation of ASTRA can be made either through Pypi or through github:


=== "Pypi"

    ``` bash
    pip install ASTRA
    ```

=== "github"

    ``` sh
    git clone git@github.com:Kamuish/ASTRA.git
    cd ASTRA
    pip install . 
    ```

By default, ASTRA does not install Telfit as it will only be needed for the masking of the telluric features. If this is the goal, it must be installed manually.
