    "# Selecting Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "When using SBART we can reject observations in two different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- globally - they are effectivelly discarded for all SBART operations\n",
    "- temporarily -Only disable them for the creation of the Stellar Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the two rejection types have completely different effects, we always use the same format\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Based on Header values\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allows to define bounds for the \"valid\" values that a given header value can take.\n",
    "- The bounds argument takes a list of list, with each entry defining a \"region\" that the value can take.\n",
    "- If we want to place no upper/lower limits, we can place a None\n",
    "\n",
    "``` py\n",

    "    # Only use observations that can have AIRMASS smaller than 1.5 or larger than 1.6\n",

    "\n",
    "    # Only select observations that have a previous RV error (the one from the CCF) smaller than 50 meter_second\n",
    "    # Note1: the conditions for 'RV related' values (previousRV, drift, BERV) must be in meter_second OR kilometer_second\n",

    "## Combining conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine multiple conditions, sum them together.\n",
    "The observations will be rejected if **any** Condition decides to reject it\n",

    "    full_conditions = valid_AIRM_condition + valid_error_condition + bad_filename_condition + bad_subInst_condition\n",

    "## Applying the conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "For a *DataClass*  object, we can use its *reject_observations* method\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "    data.reject_observations(full_conditions)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, other data-aggregation methods usually allow to provide a condition model to help specify the observations of interest."
